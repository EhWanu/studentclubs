> We are proud to announce the 2017 Edition of NeuroTechX Student Club Initiative!

After a successful launch in 2016 as a pilot project with universities in Montreal and Toronto, we are now expanding and inviting undergrads from all around the world to join us in this great adventure! We started with 5 student clubs in 2016 and already have 11 student clubs as of April 2017 and expect to close the year with a good 15 student clubs!
