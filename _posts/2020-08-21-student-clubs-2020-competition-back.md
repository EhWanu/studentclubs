After postponing the NeuroTechX Student Club Competition back in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 situation, we are excited to let you know that the competition is back on track! **The new date is November 22nd, 2020.**


The format is exactly the same. 


Given that the current situation is "our new normal" we've decided to resume our activities while adapting to this new reality and working all together (with all of you) to come up with the best course of action. We are aware that the situation is not the same at all schools and that some student clubs might feel at as disanvatage. We apologize for this situation and are trying to aim for the best compromises.


__In order to reduce the impact on the annual calendar for 2021 and 2022, we will host a Special Edition in 2021. There will be a specific challenge, announced on January 2021 and the competition/submission date will be in April 2021__


In the meantime, stay safe, healthy and get to work :)

-The NTX Student Club Committee
