<div id="divOnline">
<p>The <a href="http://neurotechx.com/">NTX</a> <a href="http://neurotechx.com/studentclubs.html">SC Online Competition</a> has two components: a fixed challenge and an open challenge.</p>
<p>All team must submit a <strong>10-min video</strong> including a presentation and a demonstration of the project, for both challenges. All team must also provide a <strong>public GitHub repository</strong>, including the project components and a comprehensive description with all the steps to reproduce it. An example will soon be provided. The deadline for submitting a project to any of the two challenges is by the end of November, 2017. <strong>All projects must be reproducible and open-source.</strong></p>
<h2>Participation rules</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The team must be composed of at least three (3) undergraduate students from the same university (or campus). Make sure you can use your university name.</li>
	<li>The team must have a web page with a team name &amp; administrators (point of contact).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Open challenge</h2>
<p><strong>The open challenge</strong> aims at increasing the overall creativity of neurotech students. All projects related to neurotechnologies are allowed. Specific rules are listed hereafter:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The project has to be<strong> related to neurotechnology</strong>, but there is no restriction on the type of project, it could be an art project, a game, a medical solution, etc.<br />Here is a non-exhaustive list of neuro-tech-related fields:</li>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
		<li>Your body is the input: EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG, GSR, temperature, blood pressure, etc.</li>
		<li>Cognitive neuroscience</li>
		<li>Computational neuroscience</li>
		<li>Neuroimaging</li>
		<li>etc.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>A prototype is mandatory.</li>
	<li>A proposal of the project should be submitted and approved at least 2 month prior.</li>
	<li>While re-doing existing projects is valuable, something &lsquo;novel&rsquo; is expected. #NeuroInnovation</li>
</ol>
<p> <em>Replicating existing technologies is allowed and will not be undervalued.</em></p>
<p><em> A EEG dataset is suggested for software and EEG-oriented project but not mandatory.</em><strong></strong></p>
<h2>Fixed challenge</h2>
<p><strong>The fixed challenge</strong> aims at increasing the general knowledge of neurotech students by challenging them to build a <strong>fully home-made</strong> acquisition <strong>pipeline</strong> for EEG signals, including the following five stages (stages 2 and 3 can be switched depending on stage 1), with variable constraints from year to year.</p>
<p>Each stage has specific objectives (italic items is required):</p>
<ol>
	<li>Acquisition</li>
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
		<li><em><em>Develop an home-made acquisition board, with at least 1 channel</em></em></li>
		<li><em>Total cost of board must not exceed 1000 USD (excluding R&amp;D)</em></li>
	</ol>
	<li>Signal processing
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li><em><em>Focus on signal of interest (EEG) and remove artifacts and noise</em></em></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Data transmission
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li><em><em>Data must be acquired with a speed of at least 200 Hz</em></em></li>
			<li>Transmitted to a distant computer wirelessly or not</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Real-time visualization
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li><em><em>Real-time visualization of signal in the time and frequency domains, for each acquisition channel</em></em></li>
			<li>An &ldquo;alpha mode&rdquo; must enable the easy characterization of the alpha band power, following a open/close paradigm</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Data recording
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li><em><em>Data must be stored on a computer with appropriate data format for latter use</em></em></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<h2>2017 constraints</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Acquisition of EEG signal is recommended (pipeline could be presented with EMG or ECG).</li>
	<li>Acquisition chips such as ADS1299 are accepted.</li>
	<li>PCB are highly recommended (not mandatory).</li>
	<li>Open-source libraries for data transmission and visualization are allowed, full package such as OpenVibe are not allowed.</li>
</ul>
