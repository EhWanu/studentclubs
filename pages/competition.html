The NTX SC Online Competition has two components: a *fixed challenge* and an *open challenge*.

All team must submit a 10-min video including a presentation and a demonstration of the project, for both challenges. All team must also provide a public GitHub repository, including the project components and a comprehensive description with all the steps to reproduce it. An example will soon be provided. The deadline for submitting a project to any of the two challenges is by the end of November, 2017. All projects must be reproducible and open-source.

Participation rules
The team must be composed of at least three (3) undergraduate students from the same university (or campus). Make sure you can use your university name.
The team must have a web page with a team name and administrators (point of contact).

The open challenge aims at increasing the overall creativity of neurotech students. All projects related to neurotechnologies are allowed. Specific rules are listed hereafter:
The project has to be related to neurotechnology, but there is no restriction on the type of project, it could be an art project, a game, a medical solution, etc. 
Here is a non-exhaustive list of neuro-tech-related fields:
Your body is the input: EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG, GSR, temperature, blood pressure, etc.
Cognitive neuroscience
Computational neuroscience
Neuroimaging
etc.
A prototype is mandatory.
A proposal of the project should be submitted and approved at least 2 month prior.
While re-doing existing projects is valuable, something ‘novel’ is expected. #NeuroInnovation


* Replicating existing technologies is allowed and will not be undervalued.
* A EEG dataset is suggested for software and EEG-oriented project but not mandatory.
