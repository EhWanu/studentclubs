### Do we have to call our student club NeuroTech[something] like most of NeuroTechX initiatives and chapters?
No. We actually discourage you to name your student club with “NeuroTech” in it, as cities Chapters are named NeuroTech[City]. Be original!

### We have our own project we’d like to work on, can we pick our own projects?
Of course! The competition has two types of challenges: a fixed and an open challenge. We encourage you to explore what you’d like!

### We are not an “official” student club recognized by our university, can we still be part of NeuroTechX Student Club Initiative and Competitions?
Yes! All you need is a written confirmation from your university that we can use the university name and logo when referring to your group.

### Wow! I want to join, where do I start?
Follow the step at the [Get Started](/studentclubs/get-started/) page and reach out to us!

### I’m a graduate student, can I participate?
The competition is for undergraduate students only, but you can still act as a mentor for your university club!

### I am not a University student (ex: Cegep), can I create a club?
Unfortunately, the competition is only for university students. Please reach out to us if you want to get involved into creating new types of competition.

### Do we need graduate students or professors in our group?
No, but graduate students and professors may help you getting started.

### There is already a student club at my university, but I don’t like them (or what they work on), can I start another club?
Yes, however you are strongly encouraged to support your home university’s student club. Please reach out to us if such a need

### My university doesn’t have “student clubs”, can we still join?
Yes, you can register as a student group. Make sure your university agrees for you to use its name.
